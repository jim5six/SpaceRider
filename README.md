# Space Rider (Harlem Globe trotters Gieger retheme)
Early solid state pinball implementation
ToDo list:
* Fix bonus count and bonus hold. Currently bonus is a mess and doent work right. Needs to be created as a goal as well (lower E lights solid when max bunus is achieved) (DONE)
* Make attract lightshow more robust and have it run is sequence. Spiral, Up, Down, Left, Right; repeat
    * JIM 6/2 - Light show is running sequentially. Needs some work on the show itself but working properly.
* Remove all aspects of Goal count showing in first display digit (DONE)
* Fix display countdown timers (can they be assigned to individual displays so they dont fight each other?)
* All goals should be able to be completed simultaniously (DONE)
* Add hurry up background sound while timers are running. Currently plays sound but never stops. (DONE)
* Randomize background songs when ball starts. (need to make more songs to add to game) (DONE)
* Blast off collect does not work. Ball gets stuck in the saucer and goal is not achieved, I think the second time you hit saucer it works. (DONE)
    * JIM 5/29 - works now, collect and call out. lights stay blinking until end of ball however. (DONE)
* I would like to change the light show for blast off collect.
* If all goals are commpleted in a game ( (S)Super spinner, (P)Pop bumper Frenzy, (A)Blast off collect, (C)Max bonus (E)5x playfield). A cool wizard mode needs to be created.
* Figure out what to do with the standup targets complete
* Something to give an extra ball
* Drop targets reset too much - once on game start
* Only reset drop targets if you have to
* Skill shot SPACE letter holds on any switch hit
* What to do with the SPACE letters after skill shot phase?
* Hurry up music ends randomly if you start multiple modes
