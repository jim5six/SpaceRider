# Space Rider (Harlem Globe trotters Gieger retheme)
Early solid state pinball implementation
ToDo list:
Fix bonus count and bonus hold. Currently bonus is a mess and doent work right. Needs to be created as a goal as well (lower E lights solid when max bunus is achieved)
Make attract lightshow more robust and have it run is sequence. Spiral, Up, Down, Left, Right; repeat
Remove all aspects of Goal count showing in first display digit
Fix display countdown timers (can they be assigned to individual displays so they dont fight each other?)
All goals should be able to be completed simultaniously
Add hurry up background sound while timers are running. Currently plays sound but never stops.
Randomize background songs when ball starts. (need to make more songs to add to game)
Blast off collect does not work. Ball gets stuck in the saucer and goal is not achieved, I think the second time you hit saucer it works.
I would like to change the light show for blast off collect.
If all goals are commpleted in a game ( (S)Super spinner, (P)Pop bumper Frenzy, (A)Blast off collect, (C)Max bonus (E)5x playfield). A cool wizard mode needs to be created.
