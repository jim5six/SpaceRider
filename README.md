# Space Rider (Harlem Globe trotters Gieger retheme)
Early solid state pinball implementation
ToDo list:
* 7/23 - No default blastoff light after skill shot - TJS need to replace turning off all lights with individual turn-on logic
* 7/23 - ball save on after wizard mode (returning to game). OK not really... The lights blink but once first switch hit is made its off. I guess its accounting for a switch hit is required to consider the ball is on the playfield, so this is fine i think...
